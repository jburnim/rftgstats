rftgstats
=========

This is a fork (more of mirror, really) of the Race for the Galaxy statistics
code (http://code.google.com/p/rftgstats/) of rrenaud, Danny, and Aragos.

The main purpose of this fork is to use Github to host a version of the
computed RFTG statistics, at: http://jburnim.github.com/rftgstats/
